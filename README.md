# xreg-gui
A simple GUI to perform 2D/3D registration using xreg as backbone


# Documentation

The current documentation of the xreg GUI is hosted on Github pages using the following link: [xreg GUI Documentation](https://jhu-bigss.github.io/xreg_gui/)

Issues: The format does not work now on github pages (not sure what the problem is) but the documentation can still be accesssed locally by:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/jhu-bigss/xreg_gui.git
```
navigate to xreg_gui/docs and open index.html in a browser, and the GUI documentation should be displayed.
