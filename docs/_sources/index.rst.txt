**BIGSS XReg GUI** is a graphical user interface designed to facilitate medical image processing tasks such as Digital Reconstructed Radiograph (DRR) generation and image registration using the xreg library, developed by Robert Grupp.

For the original xreg library, please visit the following Github repository [here](https://github.com/rg2/xreg).

The current BIGSS version of the xreg library is available [here](https://github.com/jhu-bigss/xreg), with some modifications to the packages used and the addition of some new features.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for new users to understand and utilize the GUI effectively. The documentation is currently maintained by Ping-Cheng Ku (pku1@jh.edu). If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.
