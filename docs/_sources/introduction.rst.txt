**BIGSS xreg GUI** is a user-friendly interface designed to simplify complex medical imaging tasks such as Digital Reconstructed Radiograph (DRR) generation and image registration. It leverages the capabilities of the **xreg** library, making advanced image processing accessible to users without extensive programming knowledge.

The GUI guides users through selecting processes, configuring parameters, and executing tasks, providing visual feedback and process monitoring.

The primary purpose of the BIGSS xreg GUI is to provide an intuitive interface for 2D/3D registration tasks. Tge GUI simplifies the workflow for generating DRRs and performing image registration by utilizing automatically generated config scripts to handle xreg execution. It also offers visualizations of registration results and intermediate outputs.
